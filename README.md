# Face-and-Motion-detector-OpenCV
Learn OpenCV while building a face, object, and motionÂ detector

## 1. Installing dependencies

Installing dependencies is the first thing you want to do.

```
#Library Management Package
sudo apt install python3-pip

#Libraries
pip3 install pandas
pip3 install opencv-python --user

```

## 2. Understanding files in the directory

### Step by Step Solution
I have created different files for each step in creating the interactive dictionary, here's the description of what each file does. 

* images01.py|images02.py|images03.py
  * Loading, Displaying, Resizing and writing Images. Also, Batch image resizing.

* faces-image-01.py | faces02-image-02.py
  * Detecting faces in the images

* video1.py
  * How to capture a video from webcam/external camera

* faces-video-01.py
  * Detecting faces and other objects in video in real time

* object-motion-time.py
  * Record time for the object, whenever it enters and exits the frame.


*Note: All files are integrated with comments to help you understand each and every line/command of the code.*
